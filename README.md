10. Release entire application and system as a product (Good to have feature)

# Building a system with the requirements you've outlined involves a comprehensive approach and the use of various tools and services. Below is a high-level guide on how you might structure and implement these features:

### 1. Ephemeral Deployment:

Use containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for ephemeral deployments of UI, API, and Android components.

- **Dockerfiles:** Create Dockerfiles for each component (UI, API, Android).
- **Kubernetes Manifests:** Define Kubernetes manifests for deploying and managing containers.
- **Helm Charts:** Use Helm to package and deploy applications on Kubernetes.

### 2. Release Management for Android:

Leverage Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of your Android app.

- **Build Pipeline:** Automate the build process for your Android app.
- **Release Pipeline:** Create a release pipeline that includes steps to sign and push releases to the Play Store.

### 3. Scaling Strategies:

Utilize Kubernetes for scaling strategies:

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Automatically scale the number of replicas based on resource usage.
- **Vertical Scaling:** Use Kubernetes features for vertical pod autoscaling.
- **Hybrid Scaling:** Combine horizontal and vertical scaling based on specific criteria.

### 4. A/B Testing:

Integrate A/B testing tools into your application code and infrastructure.

- **Feature Flags:** Use feature flags to control the rollout of new features.
- **Analytics Tools:** Integrate analytics tools to monitor user behavior and performance.

### 5. Telemetry/Monitoring/Tagging:

Implement monitoring and telemetry with Azure Monitor or similar tools.

- **Application Insights:** Integrate Application Insights for detailed telemetry and monitoring.
- **Logging:** Implement centralized logging using tools like ELK stack or Azure Log Analytics.
- **Tagging:** Tag resources for better organization and tracking.

### 6. Multiple Payment Systems:

Integrate multiple payment gateways into your application.

- **Payment Gateways:** Use APIs from multiple payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, etc.).
- **Payment Orchestration:** Implement an orchestration layer to manage interactions with different payment systems.

### 7. Dynamic Payment System Selection:

Implement a dynamic strategy for selecting payment systems based on criteria like ratios, banks, regions, etc.

- **Decision Engine:** Create a decision engine that evaluates criteria and selects the appropriate payment system.

### 8. High Throughput API/Messaging Systems:

Design your APIs and messaging systems for high throughput.

- **API Gateway:** Use a high-performance API gateway (e.g., NGINX, Kong).
- **Messaging Queue:** Implement scalable messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka).

### 9. Manual Pipeline Actions:

Add buttons to your CI/CD pipeline for manual actions.

- **Custom Actions:** Create custom scripts or use platform-specific features to trigger manual actions (create/destroy/update).

### 10. Product Release:

Consider packaging your entire application and system as a product.

- **Productization:** Document and package your infrastructure, configurations, and application code as a deployable product.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Security:** Implement security best practices at every layer of your application.
- **Testing:** Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests in your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation for setup, deployment, and maintenance.

Remember that each of these aspects involves detailed implementation and configuration. It's recommended to start small, iterate, and gradually add complexity as needed. Additionally, always consider the cost implications of the services and resources you use, and optimize for efficiency.

`AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` are not directly available in the Azure portal. Instead, you need to create an Azure AD App Registration, and during the registration process, you'll obtain these values.

##Here's a step-by-step guide on how to obtain `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`:

1. **Create an Azure AD App Registration:**
   - Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - In the left sidebar, navigate to "Azure Active Directory."
   - Under "App registrations," click on "New registration."
   - Fill in the required details:
     - **Name:** Give your app a name (e.g., GitHubActionsApp).
     - **Supported account types:** Choose the appropriate option (e.g., "Accounts in this organizational directory only" for a single tenant).
     - **Redirect URI:** This is not required for service principals.
   - Click "Register" to create the app registration.

2. **Note the Application (client) ID (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`):**
   - After registration, you'll be taken to the app details page.
   - Note the "Application (client) ID." This is your `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`.

3. **Create a Client Secret (`AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`):**
   - In the app details page, go to "Certificates & Secrets."
   - Under "Client secrets," click on "New client secret."
   - Enter a description, select an expiry period, and click "Add."
   - Note the value of the client secret immediately after creation. This is your `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`. Ensure you copy it securely, as it won't be visible again.
4. **Locate TENANT_ID (`TENANT_ID`):**
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, click on "Azure Active Directory."
   - Under "Manage," click on "Properties."
   - Look for the "Directory ID" field. The value displayed there is your TENANT_ID or Directory ID.

With these values, you can securely authenticate and authorize your Azure AD App Registration to perform actions in your Azure subscription. Remember to store these values securely, and avoid sharing them openly.
